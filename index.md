### Correct linking of .html and .pdf files:


* [Correct Example 1](https://bu-ie-423.github.io/fall-23-ilaydacelenkk/IE423_Fall23_Syllabus.pdf): The .pdf file is in the same location with your index file.
* [Correct Example 2](https://bu-ie-423.github.io/fall-23-ilaydacelenkk/files/How%20to%20export%20your%20work%20as%20an%20HTML%20file.pdf): The .html file is in a folder called files and this folder is in the same location with your index file.

* [Correct Example 3](IE423_Fall23_Syllabus.pdf): You can use the path and the file name only.

* [Correct Example 4](files/How%20to%20export%20your%20work%20as%20an%20HTML%20file.pdf): You can use the path and the file name only.

* [Wrong Example](https://github.com/BU-IE-423/fall-23-ilaydacelenkk/blob/main/IE423_Fall23_Syllabus.pdf): Do not provide links with "blob" or "main". Be careful with this issue while linking your Homework Assignments.
